qgisMinimumVersion=3.0
description=Copies features across different layers
version=1.0
author=Dorset Council
email=gis@dorsetcouncil.gov.uk

It also allows you to keep the selected features as individual polygons with the source style (well colour and opacity). This allows you to mosaic together features from different source layers into a single dataset.
